# Node-Time-Machine

Steps:
1. Clone repo
2. Run ./downloader.sh to compile the modified node binary
3. Run ./configureBuildPack.sh to set the buildpack for your project
4. Run ./changeDateTime.sh which will create a text file that node will look for to set the current time


Note: All scripts (save for cloning) should be run in the source of your project
